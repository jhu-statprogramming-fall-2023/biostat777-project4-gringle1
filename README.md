# biostat777-project4-gringle1

For project 4, I created a dashboard which explores the child care cost data  from the [National Database of Childcare Prices](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/featured-childcare){.uri}, which is available for download with a data dictionary via [TidyTuesday on Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md){.uri}.

The dashboard is available here:
